            <h1>We created Shine for all of us.</h1>
            <p class="sc-jGFFOr brsstv sc-lnrBVv dhDaXI">We’re on a mission to make caring for your mental and emotional health easier, more representative, and more inclusive—of <i> all </i> of our experiences.
                <br><br>
            We started Shine because we didn’t see ourselves—a Black woman and a half-Japanese woman—and our experiences represented in mainstream “wellness.” Our bodies, our skin color, our financial access, our past traumas—it all often felt otherized.
                <br><br>
            We met as coworkers, and the support we found in each other changed <b> everything </b>. We knew we had to help more people cope, process, and heal on a daily basis in a way that worked for them.
                <br><br>
            That’s what we hope Shine does for you.
                <br><br>
            We hope it’s your inclusive self-care toolkit to help you deal with the day-to-day highs and lows, and, with time, find healing that will last you a lifetime.
                <br><br>
            You got this,
            </p>
